## Game Overview
The design inspiration for this game comes from the turn-based games we used to play with pen and eraser on the desktop during our childhood. The game only requires the use of a mouse. Just like pulling a slingshot, hold the left mouse button and drag on the screen. The arrows that appear indicate the direction and magnitude of the force about to be applied to the object. Please note that the chosen point of force will affect the movement of the object~

For specific rules, please refer to the in-game instructions.

Independent Development

## Design Concept

The inspiration for this project comes from the turn-based tabletop collision game I used to play with pencils and erasers on my desktop during my childhood.

## Game Mechanics

The game primarily relies on physics-based object collisions. Players only need to predict the movement path of objects and use the mouse to catapult them, knocking down opposing objects from the arena.

## Game Highlights

Players must anticipate the movement paths of objects and navigate through peculiar traps and power-ups on the map. The absurd objects and bizarre collision effects make it highly addictive.
